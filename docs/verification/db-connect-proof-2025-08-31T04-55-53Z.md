# Database Connection Proof - 2025-08-31T04-55-53Z

## Connection Status
DB Host: db***vx.supabase.co (masked)
DB Name: postgres
Port: 5432 (direct), 6543 (pooler)
API .env: apps/hr-api/.env (DATABASE_URL set)

## Connection Issues Encountered
1. **Direct Connection**: DNS resolution failed for db.rsmiyfqgqheorwvkokvx.supabase.co
2. **Pooler Connection**: aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543 returned "Tenant or user not found"

## Fallback Mode
- API running in **in-memory mode** due to database connectivity issues
- Server started successfully on http://localhost:3001
- Work Orders endpoint responding correctly with simulated RLS

## Evidence Files
- Role Proof: .local\secure\rls_probe.txt (simulated)
- HTTP Probe: .local\secure\api_probe.json (successful)
- NSLookup: .local\secure\nslookup.txt (DNS resolution attempts)
- Connection Test: .local\secure\psql_smoketest.txt (failure documented)

## API Test Results
- Endpoint: /api/v1/work-orders
- Response: 200 OK with filtered data based on x-org-id header
- RLS simulation working correctly in memory mode

## Next Steps Required
1. Resolve DNS issues for Supabase direct connection
2. Verify correct project reference for pooler connection
3. Create app_user role once database connection is established
4. Update DATABASE_URL to use app_user credentials
