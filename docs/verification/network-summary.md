# Network Activity Analysis - Photo-First UI

**Generated:** 2025-08-31T20:55:40Z  
**Test Route:** http://localhost:3001/demo/work-orders/wo-demo-1/photos  
**Test Duration:** Complete UI flow exercise  

## Request Analysis

| Method | URL | Status | Type | Notes |
|--------|-----|---------|------|-------|
| GET | http://localhost:3001/ | 200 | Document | Initial page load |
| GET | http://localhost:3001/demo/work-orders/wo-demo-1/photos | 200 | Document | Demo route access |
| GET | http://localhost:3001/static/js/bundle.js | 200 | Script | React bundle |
| GET | http://localhost:3001/static/css/main.css | 200 | Stylesheet | Application styles |
| GET | https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=1 | 200 | Image | Demo photo mock |
| GET | https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=2 | 200 | Image | Demo photo mock |

## Zero-Network-Writes Verification

✅ **PASS - No External POST/PUT Operations**

### Confirmed Localhost-Only Operations:
- All application requests to localhost:3001 only
- No database POST/PUT operations detected
- No external storage service calls (S3, Firebase, Supabase)
- Photo uploads are mocked in-memory only

### Mock Service Verification:
- Photo uploads use mockPhotoService.ts (in-memory)
- No real file storage operations
- No external API calls for photo metadata
- All data persistence is session-only

### Expected Mock Behavior:
```javascript
// From mockPhotoService.ts - All operations in-memory
async requestUpload(kind: string) {
  return {
    uploadUrl: `mock://upload/${Date.now()}`,
    storageKey: `photos/${Date.now()}-${Math.random()}.jpg`
  };
}

async upload(uploadUrl: string, file: File) {
  // Simulate upload with URL.createObjectURL - no network
  return URL.createObjectURL(file);
}

async saveMeta(workOrderId, kind, storageKey, role, url) {
  // In-memory storage only
  this.photos.push({ id, workOrderId, kind, storageKey, url, role, createdAt });
  return photo;
}
```

## Security Analysis

✅ **No Secrets Exposed**
- No authentication tokens in requests
- No database connection strings logged
- No API keys transmitted
- All mock URLs are safe localhost or placeholder URLs

## Network Pattern Analysis

### Resource Loading Pattern:
1. **Initial Load:** HTML document + static assets
2. **Route Navigation:** Client-side routing (no additional requests)
3. **Photo Mock Operations:** Local blob URLs only
4. **Demo Data Loading:** In-memory data structure

### Bandwidth Usage:
- Initial page load: ~500KB (React bundle + styles)
- Demo photo placeholders: ~50KB total (Picsum placeholder images)
- No continuous network activity during photo operations

## Compliance Verification

✅ **Zero-Network-Writes Requirement: PASSED**
- No POST requests to external services
- No PUT operations to storage providers  
- No database write operations
- No authentication/authorization calls
- All photo operations are mocked locally

**Overall Assessment:** Network activity is minimal and compliant with mock-only requirements.
