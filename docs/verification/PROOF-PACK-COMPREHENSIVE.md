## 🔍 LIVE SECURITY TESTING EVIDENCE

### Database Role Isolation Verification

```sql
-- Evidence: Non-privileged database user configuration
SELECT current_user, session_user, 
       current_setting('is_superuser') as is_superuser;
-- Expected: app_user, app_user, off

SELECT rolname, rolsuper, rolbypassrls 
FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = current_user;
-- Expected: app_user, false, false
```

### API Security Headers Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Expected security headers:
# x-content-type-options: nosniff
# x-frame-options: DENY  
# x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
# strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

### Rate Limiting Verification

```bash
# Test rate limit enforcement
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -H "x-org-id: test-org" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/work-orders
done
# Expected: x-ratelimit-* headers with declining remaining count
```

### Pre-commit Security Scanning

```bash
echo "password=supersecret123" > test.js
git add test.js && git commit -m "test: potential secret"
# Expected: Hook blocks commit with security warning
```

## 🚨 THREAT MODEL COVERAGE

### ✅ Mitigated Threats

1. **Supply Chain Attacks**
   - Control: Pinned toolchain versions
   - Evidence: `.nvmrc`, `package.json` engines, CI validation

2. **Configuration Vulnerabilities**  
   - Control: Environment validation with dotenv-safe
   - Evidence: Required variable validation, dual auth strategies

3. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Control: Non-privileged database users with RLS
   - Evidence: `app_user` role without `BYPASSRLS`

4. **Data Loss**
   - Control: Automated backup with verification
   - Evidence: `pg_dump` scripts with integrity checking

5. **API Abuse**
   - Control: Rate limiting, input validation, security headers
   - Evidence: Multi-tier rate limits, ValidationPipe, helmet

6. **Cross-Site Attacks**
   - Control: CORS allowlist, CSP headers, XSS protection
   - Evidence: Origin validation, security middleware

7. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - Control: Automated updates with security prioritization
   - Evidence: Renovate config, npm audit in CI

8. **Code Quality Regressions**
   - Control: Pre-commit hooks with security scanning
   - Evidence: Husky hooks, ESLint rules, secret detection

### ⚠️ Residual Risk Areas

1. **Runtime Authentication** - JWT/OAuth not yet implemented (planned)
2. **Container Security** - Docker image scanning not implemented (future)
3. **API Rate Limiting** - Currently IP+Org based, consider user-based limits

## 🔧 OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

### Security Incident Response

1. **Vulnerability Detection**
   - Renovate creates high-priority PR
   - CI blocks builds with critical vulnerabilities
   - Security team notified via GitHub alerts

2. **Configuration Changes**
   - Pre-commit hooks validate all changes
   - Database migrations require manual safety review
   - Environment changes must pass validation

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Performance metrics tracked in `/api/metrics`
   - Error rates monitored per organization
   - Security headers validated in CI

### Maintenance Procedures

1. **Weekly Dependency Updates** (Automated)
   - Renovate runs Mondays at 6 AM
   - Security updates processed immediately
   - Major updates scheduled monthly

2. **Database Backup Verification** (Manual)
   - Run `tools/db/backup.mjs` monthly
   - Test restore procedure quarterly
   - Validate RLS policies after schema changes

3. **Security Posture Review** (Quarterly)
   - Execute `scripts/comprehensive-security-test.mjs`
   - Review threat model for new risks
   - Update security controls as needed
