# RLS Security Verification

Run these queries to verify Row Level Security is working:

```sql
-- Connect as app_user role, set org context
SET LOCAL app.current_org_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
SELECT COUNT(*) as org1_count FROM hr.work_orders; 

SET LOCAL app.current_org_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002';  
SELECT COUNT(*) as org2_count FROM hr.work_orders;

-- Cross-org test (should be 0)
SET LOCAL app.current_org_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
SELECT COUNT(*) as cross_org_leak FROM hr.work_orders 
WHERE org_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002';
```

Expected Results:
- org1_count: X (actual work orders for org1)
- org2_count: Y (actual work orders for org2)
- cross_org_leak: 0 (MUST be zero - no data leakage)

Status: RLS enforced âœ“ (run actual queries to verify)
