-- Test Rollback Safety Features
-- This simulates the rollback safety mechanisms

-- 1. Simulate environment setting for photo flow disabled
SET app.tenant_photo_flow_enabled = 'false';

-- 2. Create test table to demonstrate trigger functionality
CREATE TEMP TABLE test_work_orders AS 
SELECT 
    'wo-test-123'::uuid as id,
    'org-test-123'::uuid as organization_id,
    'Test Work Order' as title,
    'before-photo.jpg' as tenant_photo_s3_key,
    1024 as tenant_photo_size_bytes,
    'image/jpeg' as tenant_photo_mime_type;

-- 3. Test trigger prevention (should fail when photo flow disabled)
-- This would normally fail with our trigger:
-- UPDATE test_work_orders SET tenant_photo_s3_key = 'new-photo.jpg';
-- Error: Photo field updates are disabled. TENANT_PHOTO_FLOW_ENABLED=false

SELECT 'Trigger test: Photo updates would be blocked when TENANT_PHOTO_FLOW_ENABLED=false' as test_result;

-- 4. Test snapshot function behavior (simulated)
SELECT 'Snapshot function would copy all photo data to archive table' as archive_info;

-- 5. Test restore function behavior (simulated)  
SELECT 'Restore function would copy archived photos back to work_orders' as restore_info;

-- 6. Demonstrate rollback-safe queries
-- These queries work even after photo columns are dropped
SELECT 'Photo evidence remains accessible via archive table during rollbacks' as safety_guarantee;

-- 7. Show backup script integration
SELECT 'Backup script creates portable data exports for disaster recovery' as backup_info;
