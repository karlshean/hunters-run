# Complete Architecture Review Package for ChatGPT

## Executive Summary

I'm building **Hunters Run Property Management** - an enterprise-grade property management platform designed to outperform AppFolio, Buildium, and similar solutions. This is the flagship product in a unified 5-app platform targeting small to large property management companies (100-10,000+ units).

**Business Model:** $3,000 setup + $50/month per property  
**Target Market:** Property managers serving "unbanked, low-tech" tenant demographics  
**Differentiator:** Photo-first maintenance, court-ready documentation, cash payment support

## The Architectural Challenge

I need you to **ruthlessly stress-test** this architecture as a Senior Solutions Architect. This isn't a toy project - it needs to handle real money, legal compliance, and scale to enterprise levels.

## Part 2: Technical Architecture

### Database Strategy
**Single PostgreSQL cluster with schema separation:**
- `platform` schema: Users, organizations, roles, files, audit
- `hr` schema: Hunters Run property management entities
- Additional schemas: `ss` (server scheduling), `pc` (parent-child), etc.

**Multi-Tenancy via Row Level Security (RLS):**
- Every table has `organization_id` column
- RLS policies filter by `current_setting('app.current_org')`
- Session context set per request: `SET LOCAL app.current_org = 'uuid'`

### Authentication & Authorization
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Platform-level and product-specific roles
- Permission matrix governing all actions
- JWT tokens with embedded org/role information
- Special protections for minor users (other products)

### API Architecture
**NestJS with modular design:**
- `/auth`, `/orgs`, `/files`, `/notify` - platform services
- `/maintenance`, `/tenants`, `/properties` - Hunters Run specific
- Guards enforce RLS context and permission checking
- OpenAPI documentation auto-generated

### File & Evidence Management
**S3-compatible storage with signed URLs:**
- Photo compression and optimization
- Metadata preservation for legal compliance
- Geographic tagging and timestamp verification
- Immutable storage for evidence preservation

### Audit & Compliance
**Hash-chained event store:**
- Append-only audit events with cryptographic integrity
- Daily signed snapshots for tamper detection
- Full reconstruction capability for legal proceedings
- Export to PDF for court submissions

*[The complete PostgreSQL schema with 30+ tables is included as a separate artifact - see "Complete Hunters Run Database Schema"]*

**Key Schema Highlights:**

**Property Hierarchy:**
```sql
properties → buildings → units
- Geographic support with PostGIS
- Amenity tracking and market rent analysis
- Status management (draft → active → archived)
```

**Tenant Lifecycle:**
```sql
prospects → leads → applicants → tenants → former_tenants
- Complete application and screening workflow
- Emergency contacts and employment verification
- Communication preferences and language support
```

**Maintenance System:**
```sql
work_orders → evidence → visit_attempts → completions
- 12-state workflow from submission to closure
- GPS-verified technician visits
- Photo evidence with legal timestamps
```

**Financial Management:**
```sql
charges → payments → allocations
- Multi-charge payment allocation
- Utility billing with RUBS support
- Late fee automation and payment plans
```

**Legal Compliance:**
```sql
legal_notices → service_tracking → court_documentation
- State-specific notice templates
- Proof of service documentation
- Integration with eviction proceedings
```

## Part 4: Critical Questions for Review

### 1. Database Architecture & Performance
- **RLS Scalability:** Will RLS perform adequately with 10,000+ units across complex JOIN queries?
- **Index Strategy:** Are the provided indexes sufficient for property management query patterns?
- **Concurrent Load:** How will this handle 500 simultaneous maintenance requests?
- **Data Growth:** What happens when audit tables reach millions of rows?

### 2. Business Logic Completeness
- **State Machine Gaps:** Are the 15+ entity lifecycles complete for real-world edge cases?
- **Workflow Automation:** What business rules am I missing that will require manual intervention?
- **Integration Points:** What third-party systems do property managers expect that I haven't considered?
- **Reporting Requirements:** Can this schema support the complex financial reports property managers need?

### 3. Legal & Compliance Risks
- **Evidence Integrity:** Is the hash-chained audit sufficient for court proceedings?
- **Data Retention:** How do I handle conflicting retention requirements across jurisdictions?
- **Privacy Compliance:** What GDPR/CCPA considerations am I missing?
- **Backup & Recovery:** How do I maintain audit integrity during disaster recovery?

### 4. Technical Implementation Concerns
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Is RLS the right choice or should I use application-level isolation?
- **Mobile Performance:** How do I optimize photo uploads for users on poor connections?
- **Real-Time Updates:** What's the strategy for real-time notifications across web and mobile?
- **API Security:** How do I prevent tenant data leakage in a multi-tenant system?

### 5. Scalability & Operations

## The Core Question

**Given this comprehensive architecture, what are the top 5 risks that could kill this project at enterprise scale, and what specific changes would you recommend to mitigate them?**

Focus on:
1. **Technical architecture flaws** that won't surface until 1000+ properties
2. **Business logic gaps** that will frustrate users and cost sales
3. **Legal/compliance issues** that could expose customers to lawsuits
4. **Scalability assumptions** that break under real-world load
5. **Implementation complexity** that makes the system undeliverable

Be ruthlessly honest. I'd rather redesign now than fail after 6 months of development.
